            <p> As a customer experience specialist over the years, I have learned these valuable lessons:</p>
            <ul>
		    <li>Empathy with customers and this better mastered with active listening skills, sympathy and genuine connection between you and your customer.</li>
		    <li>Problem solving skills: Every CX needs to understand that the value of your service in your demeanor.You must have a light and happyspirit</li>
	    </ul>
	    <h2>How I survivided working with SHRM even after a short note:</h2>
	    
	    <p>If there is one valubale lesson I have learned in life, it is to be develop a learning spirit. We were taught the entire job specifications within one week and we did perform absoultely well and even higher than expected. Because of this great performanc, we were promised to be reached back to once settled on full time employment contract.</p>
	   
	    <h3>Your progress boils down to your discipline and consistency</h3>
              <p>Life happens after your make plans. That's what the old forks would say and I do believe that things will not always go as planned but not having a plan as customer experience specialist as regards your vision and progress is a total waste of time. To achieve a better reult and further climax in your profession, you need to learn deiscipline and consistency as the bedrock to success.
