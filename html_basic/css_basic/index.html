      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>This is the beginning of my alx html journey learning about the basics of <strong>HTML</strong>, I have always been wondering about how information get on the net, the magic going underneath that we know and my curiosity about this magic is fulfill with introduction to HTML as a markup language for displaying webpages on browsers. 
      </p>
      <p> HTML an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language that tells the browser how to display the structure of webpage. it consists of various element such as texts, images, videos and others that are joined with tags in the body section of HTML file. The head, the part not display on browsers contain the title and meta elements of the html document all of which are embedded in the html tag.
      </p>
      <h2>Goals for learning HTML</h2>
      <p>My primary goal for learning this language is to have an insight into how things work in this rapidly developing technology era and to contribute my own knowledge into it in the area of chemical technology. In this <a href ="/storage/emulated/0/tweets.html">webpage</a> you will find more reasons for choosing this path.
